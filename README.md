# Stock Price Prediction with RNN (AAPL)

A small educational project that trains a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict Apple (AAPL) closing prices using historical data from Yahoo Finance.

## Quick summary
- Data: downloaded with `yfinance` (2015â€“2024)
- Preprocessing: `MinMaxScaler` and 10-day sliding windows
- Model: `SimpleRNN(64) -> Dense(1)` (Keras/TensorFlow)
- Output: plots comparing true vs predicted prices
